# Python Indentation

"""
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important."""

  print("Five is greater than two!")

"""
a = "Hello Word"
b = 7.5

"""
